<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Whether they're looking for new clients or want to share their work with potential employers, some people create professional websites as part of their job search. Professional websites tend to include an "About Me" section that summarizes your work history and the value you have to offer. Learning more about how to create this section can help you differentiate yourself from competitors in your field or other candidates applying for the same positions.</p>

<p>Creating an "About Me" page for your portfolio, blog or website can help you develop your professional brand. It's a personalized way to connect with potential employers and provide context for your work, which can help you differentiate yourself from other candidates during your job search. An "About Me" page may also help you develop relationships with potential clients and encourage them to work with you. Consider that because an "About Me" page is one of the first places many website visitors go to, it can be a great way to establish a good first impression of your brand.</p>

<p>As you begin to write your "About Me" page, consider who your target audience is. Understanding your target audience can help you use the appropriate language and provide information that's relevant to the reader. Consider that you might write this page for not only people familiar with your brand but also completely new readers. While the tone you use can vary based on your audience, a standard principle is to sound professional yet personal. You might also minimize the use of unnecessary jargon.</p>
